# Show Queue v2 — auto-advance + queue (build plan)

Branch `show-queue-v2` (fresh off `main`; the old `show-queue` branch is
**abandoned**, not merged). Design spec: [`docs/adr/0010-playback-auto-advance-and-show-queue.md`](../docs/adr/0010-playback-auto-advance-and-show-queue.md).
Roadmap: §1 in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

## The shape (one paragraph)

Auto-advance is an **independent coordinator** that listens for one positive
event — **`onShowCompleted(showId)`**, "the final track played to its natural
end" — and on it (optionally counts down, then) calls `playShow(next)`, which is
an ordinary play. It reads **no** transport/Connect state, so there is no fight
and no patch layer. To keep Connect from dragging the device back, the active
device sends a **park** ("I'm done") command at completion so the server stops
believing it's playing. The **queue is local-first** (works signed-out;
authoritative locally) and **syncs as a whole-list snapshot** for signed-in
users, like Favorites. The advance target is **queue head, else next show by
date** (client-resolved — the server has no catalog).

## Why this replaces the first attempt

The abandoned `show-queue` branch made advancing a client decision that
interrogated transport state and fought the server's `playing=true` (the
"advance immediately / no countdown in Connect" patch, the guessed
`isActiveDevice` gate, `isAutoAdvancing`, `hasBeenPlaying`). Root cause +
corrected model are in ADR-0010 ("Why the first model was wrong"). **Do not
reintroduce those patterns.** If you find yourself reading `playing` /
`activeDeviceId` to decide whether to advance, stop — that's the old trap.

## Build order — each chunk proven on iOS + Android + web before the next

### Chunk 1 — reliable `onShowCompleted` on all three platforms
The riskiest atom; prove it in isolation. **No advance, no park, no queue.**
- Each platform's player adapter emits/logs `onShowCompleted(showId)` only on
  natural end of the **last** track.
- Verify on-device that it fires on natural show-end and does **NOT** fire on:
  pause, user-stop, error/skip, transfer (Connect), or cold-start restored state.
- Per-platform mapping:
  - **Android (Media3):** `STATE_ENDED` + "played this session" guard.
  - **iOS (AVQueuePlayer):** `AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTime` on the last item.
  - **Web:** `ended` on the last track.
- Proof = a log/toast. Web audio verified on beta / another machine (the
  primary dev box may not output web audio — unverified note from a prior
  session; confirm by testing).

### Chunk 2 — chronological auto-advance + the park primitive
On top of Chunk 1's signal. Still no queue.
- Advance coordinator: `onShowCompleted` → (cancelable countdown) → `playShow`
  of the **next show by date** (client-resolved from catalog).
- Active device sends **park** at completion (first cut may reuse `stop`; add a
  dedicated park action only if the ~1s remote "stopped" flicker bothers us).
- **Verify the original bug is dead:** auto-advance works under a Connect session
  on Android (and iOS/web) — countdown holds, no restart/drag-back, advances on
  exactly the audio-producing device.
- If "next" fails even on *immediate* advance, suspect a background-socket
  gremlin (ADR-0007), not this logic.

### Chunk 3 — local queue feeding the advance
- Local `play_queue` store (Room / GRDB) + domain model. *(Salvageable from the
  abandoned branch — re-introduce deliberately, not wholesale.)*
- Surfaces: add-to-queue entry points, a view/reorder/remove list, tap-to-play.
- Advance target becomes **queue head, else chronological**. Works signed-out.

### Chunk 4 — whole-list snapshot sync (signed-in)
- Debounced PUT of the full queue to the userdata layer
  (`api/src/db/userdata`); last-writer-wins; first-pull on sign-in/foreground.
- Refresh queue when a device becomes active (covers transfer-mid-queue).
- Absorbs the old `show-queue-sync` project.

### Settings cleanup (independent, anytime)
The settings screen is overloaded — regroup and improve findability. Not
coupled to the queue. Keep any end-of-show options here **minimal** until the
core advance is proven (the first model over-built this matrix).

## Salvage from the abandoned `show-queue` branch (reference, don't cargo-cult)
Genuinely good, framework-level pieces (re-introduce in Chunk 3+):
- `play_queue` table + DAO/entity (Room) and GRDB record/DAO + migration.
- Domain model (`QueuedShow` / `QueuedShowItem`).
- Add-to-queue UI entry points and the Favorites "Queue" segment list rows.
Leave behind: the advance coordinator's transport-state interrogation, the
Connect guards, the end-of-show settings matrix, the interrupt snackbar.

## Gotcha: wipe stale DB on devices that ran the abandoned branch
The old `show-queue` branch bumped the schema (Android Room **v26** +
`MIGRATION_25_26`; iOS GRDB `v15-play-queue`). `show-queue-v2` is off `main`, so
its schema is **lower** — a device still holding the v26 DB crashes on launch
(`IllegalStateException: A migration from 26 to 25 was required but not found`;
Room can't downgrade). Fix: clear app data —
`adb shell pm clear com.grateful.deadly.debug` (Android) / delete+reinstall the
iOS app — before installing a `show-queue-v2` build on such a device.

## Status
2026-06-10: **Chunk 1 (`onShowCompleted` detection) — code complete, proven on
web + Android; iOS verification in progress.**
- **Web ✓** — `🏁 SHOW-COMPLETE` fires on natural end-of-show, silent on
  pause/stop/skip (browser console; needs a hard-refresh past the PWA service
  worker after each redeploy).
- **Android ✓** — fires on `READY → ENDED`; silent on pause, stop (`→ IDLE`),
  show-switch, and **force-quit + cold relaunch** (the `hasPlayedThisSession`
  guard — the exact false-positive the old build tripped on).
- **iOS ✓** — verified in Console.app (`PlaylistService` category): fires on
  natural end-of-show, silent on the negatives.

**Chunk 1 COMPLETE on all three platforms.**

**Chunk 2 — Android DONE + device-verified (`1f5091a8`).** Chronological
auto-advance works signed-out and signed-in; under Connect the park
(`sendStop`) fires and the 15s countdown survives with **no drag-back/restart**
— the original v1 bug is dead. Built as `playShow(show)` (canonical play entry
in `core:playlist`: resolve recording/format/tracks → playAll + sendLoad) +
`AutoAdvanceCoordinator` (app; subscribes to `showCompleted`, reads no transport
state).

**Chunk 2 — Web DONE + verified on localhost (`a78511be`).** `ended` → park
(`sendCommand "stop"`) → 15s → `playShow(next)`; remotes followed. Next show
resolved via new **`GET /api/shows/:id/next`** + `getNextShow()` in
`api/src/showCatalog.ts` (the browser has no catalog — shows are static SSG and
the search index lacks recording ids).

**Chunk 2 — iOS DONE + device-verified (`77a3def6`).** Advances on its own and
follows/leads under Connect. `playShow` = loadShow + playTrack(0); coordinator
`AutoAdvanceCoordinator` (@MainActor @Observable) wired in AppContainer; park via
the existing `ConnectService.sendStop()`; next-show via on-device
`getNextShow(afterDate:)`.

### ✅ Advance mechanism COMPLETE + verified on all three platforms (incl. multi-client Connect).
### ✅ Phase B (cross-device countdown over Connect) COMPLETE + verified on all three.
Server `pendingAdvance` + announce_next/cancel_advance/advance_now; each client
emits + drives the countdown/advance off the shared note; Cancel & Play-now work
from any device. Web has the fullscreen takeover; Android/iOS use a docked card.
Also fixed: Android connect-follow now resolves the ticket cover (was logo).
Remaining polish: **mobile fullscreen-takeover** (parity with web) and the
**play/pause affordance** fixes.

**"When a show ends" ship gate — DONE on all three platforms.** Per-device
opt-out gating whether THIS device initiates an advance; default ON. Android
`abafadc9` (AppPreferences + Settings "Playback"), iOS (AppPreferences
`autoAdvanceEnabled` + gated `AutoAdvanceCoordinator.onShowCompleted` + Settings
"Playback" section), web (`lib/playbackPrefs.ts` localStorage flag, gated
`onShowComplete`, toggle in `/me` SettingsTab). `feature_use` /
`toggle_auto_advance` analytics on each.
Remaining in Chunk 2 (UX/polish — mechanism is done):
1. Cancelable countdown **overlay UI** (advances silently after 15s today).
   - Also: during the countdown the active device is *parked*, so remotes render
     a bare parked scrubber and disagree on its position (Android remote → 0;
     iOS/web → held at end). Minor/cosmetic; likely resolved by giving remotes a
     proper "next show in Ns" display instead of the parked state.
2. The **"when a show ends" setting** (on/off, countdown/immediate) — needed
   before shipping (auto-advance is hardcoded ON today).
3. The **play/pause affordance fix** (iOS miniplayer icon + Android restore).

### Phase B: broadcast "next up" over Connect — full design + sequence diagrams in ADR-0010 §7
One shared note `pendingAdvance: { showId, deadline }` on `ConnectState`
(additive). **Explicit commands** `announce_next` / `cancel_advance` /
`advance_now` (no implicit nulling — that was rejected; see ADR §7 + Alternatives).
Remotes tick locally to `deadline` via `serverTimeOffsetMs` (no per-second
traffic) and resolve art/info by `showId`. Uniform rule for the playing device:
**advance iff the note is present and `now ≥ deadline`** — so Cancel (note gone)
and Play now (deadline=now) both fall out. Cancel **and Play now work from any
device** (local + remote). Doing Phase B before porting mobile UI so the
countdown UI is built ONCE per platform against a merged "local coordinator OR
broadcast note" source.

### Known pre-existing bug to fix *during* Chunk 2 (not a Chunk 1 regression)
iOS miniplayer play/pause icon **sometimes** sticks on "play" after
`ended → tap a song in the same show` — the full-player button + track highlight
stay correct. Both icons read `service.isPlaying` (= `playbackState == .playing`,
false during `.buffering`); the miniplayer-only divergence is a SwiftUI
re-render timing gap in `MiniPlayerOverlay` as the engine settles
`buffering → playing`. Fix in Chunk 2 by driving the icon off **play-intent**
(`StreamPlayer.onPlayIntentChange`, true through buffering) rather than the
knife-edge `.playing` state — Chunk 2 reworks this exact `ended → play next`
transition anyway.
