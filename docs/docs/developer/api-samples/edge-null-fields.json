They put out an LP - The Happening - just after Schiller's (and Dr. Sidney Cohen's) record, but this track - Speed Limit - is not on it.",

This is not Phil, it is actually a recording of the tune “Tijuana Gift Shop” from the Charles Mingus’ album “Tijuana Moods” (the trumpet player on the album is Clarence Shaw).  I first hear the Mingus track at around the 2:15 mark during “Speed Limit” and it comes in and out sporadically up until around the 5:00 mark.  Prior to that, around 1:50 or so you can hear a saxophone, which is John Coltrane, which is from the tune “Aisha” on his album “Olé”. \n",

In fact, if you listen closely with headphones on, you can hear that it's a mosaic of various prerecorded tracks, including spoken word and instrumental pieces.  It's sad to say, but this clearly is not an early recording from an acid session.\n\nAs another reviewer mentioned, this is not the Grateful Dead.  It sounds like an unfinished project, something that Kesey started while under the influence at some point in time.\n\nI suppose it's one place to start the Grateful Dead journey.  However, don't get your hopes up.",

In one of the tapes I got from Kesey, Neal was driving around the property doing a rap. In the other tape I got he was on the road because he is talking about the make and model of passing cars, listening to jazz and discussing other things at pretty much the same time. I don't recall actual dates but I do know they recorded audio and video for many of those early adventures. Some of the Pranksters would know the specifics regarding Speed Limit..btw tnat was the title of that particular tape from Kesey. The other is the Straight Theatre stuff from later. Cheers, Wy@",
